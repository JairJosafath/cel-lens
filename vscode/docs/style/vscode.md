# VS Code extension digest

Distilled from VS Code's extension guidelines, UX guidelines, activation events,
bundling, language server and language feature guides, the Language Server
Protocol 3.17, and GitLens, the reference for how an editor extension feels
(see `SOURCES.md`). `[lint: x]` = enforced by `make check`; `[review]` = check it
yourself.

## Activation

- Activate as late as possible, on the narrowest events that work:
  `onLanguage:yaml`, `workspaceContains:<glob>`. Never `*`; `onStartupFinished`
  only for background work that must start anyway. [review]
- Since VS Code 1.74, contributed commands, languages, views and custom
  editors activate the extension by themselves: don't list them in
  `activationEvents`. [review]
- `activate()` returns quickly: no synchronous file reads, no network, no
  waiting for work the user hasn't asked for. Start long work in the
  background and report it with progress. [review]

## Lifetime and disposal

- Everything `activate()` creates that VS Code can dispose goes into
  `context.subscriptions`: commands, providers, event listeners, file
  watchers, output channels, status bar items, the language client. [review]
- Add `deactivate()` only for asynchronous cleanup, and return its promise
  (`return client?.stop()`); VS Code waits for it. [review]
- Anything created later (per document, per request) is disposed by its owner
  when that ends. A second registration of the same command throws: that is
  how leaks show in tests. [review]

## The extension host

- Never block it: it runs every extension. No synchronous I/O on hot paths, no
  long loops on keystrokes; heavy work goes to the language server process. [review]
- Providers honour their `CancellationToken` and return quickly when it fires. [review]
- Use `vscode.workspace.fs` and `Uri`s for workspace files, so remote and
  virtual workspaces work; `node:fs` only for the extension's own files. [review]
- Support multi-root workspaces: no single "the workspace folder". [review]
- VS Code 1.100, the oldest `engines.vscode` allows, runs extensions on Node 20,
  while `@types/node` describes Node 24: use no Node API newer than Node 20. [review]
- Logs go to a `LogOutputChannel` named after the extension, never the
  console. [lint: no-console]

## The language client

- Use `vscode-languageclient` (10.x needs `engines.vscode` ^1.91, which ^1.100
  meets). It speaks LSP 3.17 to a server started over stdio:
  `{ command, args: ['serve', '--stdio'], transport: TransportKind.stdio }`. [review]
- Find the server in a fixed order, and log which one is used: the user's
  setting, then the binary shipped in the extension, then `PATH`. [review]
- The `documentSelector` is as narrow as the server's job:
  `{ scheme: 'file', language: 'yaml' }`. [review]
- `await client.start()` inside `try`. When the server is missing or crashes,
  show one actionable error ("Language server not found: set
  `<extension>.server.path` or reinstall the extension", with a button to
  the setting) and leave VS Code usable. [review]
- Contribute `<extension>.trace.server` (`off`, `messages`, `verbose`) so
  people can see the protocol in the output channel. [review]
- Don't redo the server's work in the client: diagnostics, completion and
  hover come from the server. [review]

## Language Server Protocol 3.17

- Lifecycle: `initialize` (requests before it get error -32002), `initialized`,
  then work; `shutdown`, then `exit`. [review]
- Positions are zero-based line and character. Characters count UTF-16 code
  units unless the client offered, and the server chose, another
  `positionEncoding`. Range ends are exclusive. Convert with care around
  non-ASCII text. [review]
- Text sync is Full or Incremental; every change raises the document version. [review]
- `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` replaces a document's diagnostics; an empty
  array clears them. [review]
- `$/cancelRequest` cancels; the server still answers, with RequestCancelled
  (-32800), or ContentModified (-32801) when the document changed under it. [review]
- Answer requests in roughly the order they came, unless reordering can't change
  the result. [review]
- Over stdio, stdout carries only protocol messages (`Content-Length` framed
  JSON-RPC); anything else breaks the connection. [review]

## UX

- **Notifications:** only when necessary, one at a time, never repeated, never
  for promotion or feedback on first install. Errors say what happened and
  offer the fix as a button. Recurring ones offer "Don't show again". [review]
- **Progress:** long operations show progress with a cancel action when they
  can stop, and a link to the logs; never left spinning. [review]
- **Modal dialogs** only when the user must decide now, never to show
  information. [review]
- **Status bar:** at most one item, short text, an icon only for a clear
  metaphor; contextual items on the right; no custom colours (the error and
  warning backgrounds only for blocking problems). [review]
- **Commands:** clear names in Title Case, all under one `category` (the
  extension's display name), no emojis; don't override existing keybindings. [review]
- **Settings:** prefixed with the extension's name; each has a default and a
  short `description` or `markdownDescription` (linking related settings); the
  right `scope`; listed in the README. No custom settings pages. [review]

## The UX bar: GitLens

GitLens is the reference for how an extension that lives in the editor feels:
what a person needs is at the code they are reading, quiet until they look,
one step from the details, and one command from off. A change that adds or
alters something a person sees meets these rules; the review checks them as
it checks correctness.

### Inline first

- **Information sits at the code it is about,** in this order of preference:
  a diagnostic on the exact range, a hover, a CodeLens above the block, an
  inlay hint at the end of the expression. A view, a notification or the
  output channel only for what has no place in the text. [review]
- **Quiet by default.** Inline text is short (a few words, a count, a
  result), uses the theme's muted colours (`editorCodeLens.foreground`,
  `editorInlayHint.*`) or a contributed colour with light, dark and both
  high-contrast defaults, and never more than one annotation per line from
  the extension. [review]
- **Every kind of annotation can be turned off:** a setting, a
  **Toggle ...** command, and the same toggle in the status bar item's menu.
  A toggle takes effect at once, without a reload. [review]
- **A CodeLens does what it says when clicked;** one that only informs is
  an inlay hint or a hover instead. At most two per block, resolved lazily
  (`codeLens/resolve`) when they cost work. [review]
- **Hovers are the details layer:** one fixed order of sections (what it is,
  its type or result, why, a link to the docs), Markdown rendered like the
  code, and command links only to the extension's own commands
  (`MarkdownString.isTrusted = { enabledCommands: [...] }`, never `true`). [review]
- **Every problem the engine can fix has a quick fix,** the likely one
  marked `isPreferred`, so **Quick Fix** (`Ctrl+.`) and **Auto Fix** pick it. [review]

### Reachable from where you are

- **Every feature is in the Command Palette,** under the one category, and
  also where it applies: the editor's context menu, the editor title (at
  most one icon, the rest in the overflow), the status bar item's menu or a
  view's toolbar. Each with a `when` clause, so it shows only where it
  works; related actions grouped, a large group in a submenu. [review]
- **Quick picks** have a title when they have no text input or are a step of
  several, a placeholder that says what to type, product icons only as clear
  metaphors, the current value in `description` and brief context in
  `detail`. [review]
- **Keybindings only for actions people repeat,** scoped by `when`, never
  overriding one VS Code or a common extension already uses; listed in the
  README. [review]
- **One walkthrough** (`contributes.walkthroughs`) when the extension has
  more than one thing to learn: few steps, each one action whose label starts
  with a verb, images readable in every theme (SVG with theme colours where
  possible). The extension opens nothing by itself on install or update. [review]

### Views and webviews

- **A view only for what a person browses** (every rule in the workspace,
  results to step through), never for what could be a command. One view
  container at most, three to five views in it, each with an icon and a
  short name. [review]
- **Tree items are things, not buttons:** descriptive labels, product icons
  to tell kinds apart, at most three inline actions, shallow nesting; a
  click opens or reveals the thing. An empty view shows a welcome view
  (`viewsWelcome`): short, links over buttons, link text that names where it
  goes, never "read more" or a promotion. [review]
- **A webview only when no tree, editor or hover can show it.** Then every
  colour comes from the theme's CSS variables (`--vscode-*`), every control
  is reachable by keyboard and labelled for screen readers, contrast holds in
  high-contrast themes, and it opens only in the active window, never on
  install or update, never as a wizard. [review]

### Feel

- **It keeps up with typing.** Inline results follow an edit without a
  visible lag; work that can't shows progress in place (the view's progress
  bar, the status bar item) and never a modal. The budget is the issue's or
  the system's, measured by a bench. [review]
- **One word per idea** across commands, settings, hovers, views, the README
  and the CHANGELOG. A person who learns it once reads it everywhere. [review]
- **Colour is never the only signal:** an icon or a word says the same, for
  colour-blind people and screen readers. Status bar items and tree items
  whose label alone is unclear set `accessibilityInformation`. [review]
- **Settings live in the Settings editor:** grouped in titled sections when
  there are more than a handful, ordered by how often they change, and every
  one applies live through `onDidChangeConfiguration`. [review]
- **The README is the store page:** a short GIF or screenshot of each
  headline feature at the top, in light and dark where it differs, then
  install, the features, every command with its keybinding, and every
  setting. A new visible feature brings its picture. [review]

## Bundling and packaging

- esbuild bundles `src/extension.ts` into one CommonJS file in `out/`, with
  `vscode` external. No dynamic `require`; native modules can't be bundled. [review]
- `.vscodeignore` keeps everything but the bundle and the documents out of the
  `.vsix`. [lint: make package-check packages it]
- `engines.vscode` is the oldest VS Code the extension supports;
  `@types/vscode` never exceeds it. [lint: make package-check (vsce)]
- `package.json`'s `version` is the release; each release has a CHANGELOG
  entry, and its tag matches the version. [lint: make dist refuses a mismatch; CHANGELOG review]

## Tests

- Logic lives in modules that don't import `vscode`; vitest tests them in plain
  Node. [review]
- Code that needs `vscode` is tested against `test/vscode.ts`, the stand-in.
  Extend it with only what tests need, typed with `satisfies` against the real
  API, and clear its state in `reset()`. [review]
- No integration tests in a real VS Code (`@vscode/test-electron`): they
  download VS Code and need a display and its libraries, which the sandbox and
  CI don't have, so they can't run in `make check`. What needs a real editor
  is for a person to try. [review]
