// Package internal holds this program's packages. Only code inside this module
// can import them, so they can change without breaking anyone.
//
// The layout:
//
//   - main.go is the command. It parses the command line, wires the packages
//     together and maps errors to exit codes; it holds no other logic.
//   - Each package under internal/ has one purpose and is named for what it
//     provides (internal/config, internal/report), never util, common, helpers
//     or misc.
//   - Dependencies point one way: a package never imports the packages that
//     use it, so there are no import cycles.
//   - Tests sit next to the code they test (report_test.go next to report.go);
//     their fixtures and golden files go in that package's testdata/.
